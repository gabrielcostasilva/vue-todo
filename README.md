# Vue Todo
This project is based on [Shaun Pelling tutorial on Vue Animations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIApQjn9fvw&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9ghm7-iTfS9n468Kp7l9Ipu).

Please note that the master branch does not implement the animations, although Shaun's tutorial is all about Vue transitions. This repository has another branch dedicated to implementing transitions.

## This Branch Novelty
